# 1.2.1 Temperature Check

The temperature check phase is the first step in the governance process and is initiated on the Proposals section of the SushiSwap forum which can be accessed [here](https://forum.sushi.com/c/proposals/8).

A proposer must follow the template on the forum and include a poll. If the poll gains enough traction within the community, it will kick off Step 2 and be invited to be discussed on the weekly community call.
