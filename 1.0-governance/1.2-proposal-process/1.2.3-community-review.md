# 1.2.3 Community Review

Once a proposal passes the Temperature check phase, the proposer will be invited to discuss on the weekly community call by The Community Manager.

Simultaneously, the Community Oversight Council will work with the Sushi development team and other internal team members to gain an understanding of:

1. What kind of development resources and timeline for the proposal look like (if any)
2. What kind of revenue opportunity for the platform would the implementation of said proposal present
3. What are the risks of implementing the proposal

If there are no overt objections on the call, the proposal will be posted to Snapshot **the Monday following the Community call.**
