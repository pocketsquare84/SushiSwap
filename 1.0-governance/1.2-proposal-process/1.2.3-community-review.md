# 1.2.3 Community Review \[Pending]

Once a proposal passes the temperature check phase and the team has conducted their internal review, the proposer will be invited to discuss on the weekly community call by The Community Manager.

During this phase, the proposer will be able to state their case as well as have Q\&A with the community.  The COC will also be able to give the feedback they have gathered from the team with respect to development lift and potential risk/rewards and if they have an opinion, advise the community on it to assist the community in making an informed decision.

If there are no overt objections on the call, the proposal will be posted to Snapshot **the Monday following the Community call.**
