# 1.2.4 Implementation Vote

Once a proposal has cleared the Community Call phase, it will be posted to [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/sushigov.eth) on the following Monday. Implementation Snapshots will run for 7 days and will only pass if the vote meets quorum.

Emergency Implementation votes can skip the first 2 stages of the proposal process where deemed necessary but must be approved by the Community Oversight Committee.
