# 2.1.1 Conflict Resolution

SushiSwap is a DAO and thus the pillar of any DAO is community governance. If the COC, at any time, deems a SushiSwap employee to be acting in poor faith and/or against the wishes of the community (including but not limited to failure to comply with COC), they will have the authority to suspend that employee (and any payments to said employee). If SushiSwap employees and the COC cannot come to a mutually agreeable outcome (termination, etc), the COC must put it to the community to go through the governance process for resolution
