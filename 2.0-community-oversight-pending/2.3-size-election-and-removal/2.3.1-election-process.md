# 2.3.1 Election Process

An open call for COC voting will be initiated by the [Community Lead](../../3.0-operations/3.1-org-chart-pending/3.1.1-leadership/3.1.1.5-community-lead.md) and/or existing COC members. Those who wish to sit on the COC may nominate themselves on the [forum](https://forum.sushi.com/).  A nomination request should include their expertise, what kind of impact they think they can make, and any other information they believe to be relevant to the position.

Once a nomination is put forth on the forum, it will follow the [normal governance proposal process](../../1.0-governance/1.2-proposal-process/) to determine the candidates viability.  The only modification will be that if there are mulitple candidates the Community Lead/existing COC members can modify the timeline, at their discretion, such that they can coordinate mulitple candidates have enough time to appear on community calls and that the final snapshot for all candidates who are campaigning for the same seat should occur at the same time.
