# 2.2.4 Snapshots

It is the COC’s ultimate responsibility to ensure that governance items that pass the temperature check phase are ultimately posted to Snapshot in accordance with item [1.2.3.3](../../1.0-governance/1.2-proposal-process/1.2.4-implementation-vote/1.2.4.3-snapshot-posting.md). The COC shall hold the ability to post Snapshots regardless of SUSHIPOWAH to ensure the community is not ‘gatekept’.&#x20;
