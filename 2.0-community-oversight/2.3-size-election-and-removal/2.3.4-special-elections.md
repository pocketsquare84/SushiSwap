# 2.3.4 Special Elections

Special elections will be triggered if a COC Member resigns, becomes unable to fulfill their duties, or if there is a loss in confidence in their ability to represent the communityâ€™s best interests.

Special Elections can be triggered by anyone, including the community, via normal governance ie temperature check followed by Implementation Snapshot with the posting of Snapshots being the responsibility of the remaining Directors.  Failure to post snapshots by the COC which receive community support will trigger a suspension of any COC Member Compensation (if exists) and a Special Election for their own seat.
