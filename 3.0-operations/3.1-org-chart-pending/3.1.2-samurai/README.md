# 3.1.2 Samurai

With the [recent proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/sushigov.eth/proposal/QmbZ6cYVvfoKvkDX14jRcN86z6bfV135npUfhxmENjHnQ1) unanimously voted in, the Samurai team will lead community efforts at Sushi to help shape and boost community engagement. The core mission is to positively impact our community members while building a bridge between the community and team. Samurais will also assist in bi-directional communication with the community resulting in increased feedback, identification of community needs, and community-focused product development.

Sushi provides an authentic touchpoint for several initiatives, making it an essential part of the user experience. By tapping into the insights of active community members, Samurai will be able to help the developers figure out how to deliver the most well-thought-out experience for Sushi. This includes gathering product feedback, assessing product & community sentiment, and much more.

Samurais are committed to constantly evolving to meet our communityâ€™s needs and work closely with other teams in Sushi.
