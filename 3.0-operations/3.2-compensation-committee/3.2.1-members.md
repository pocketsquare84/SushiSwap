Initially, we propose Matthew Lilley & Neil sit on this committee as they have all been helping with the restructuring plan, interviewed all current sushi contributors, and have already begun negotiating Sushi contributor contracts.

Of note, we do want to see the compensation committee eventually expand, and expect it to.
