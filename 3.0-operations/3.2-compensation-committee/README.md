# 3.2 Compensation Committee

The Compensation Committee’s primary purpose will be to advise the COC on appropriate industry compensation packages and, with the COC’s approval, negotiate said packages with new hires. The Compensation Committee will require COC signoff to enact any employment or compensation items.

The Compensation Committee will have several main jobs:

* Compensation negotiations
* Track TWAP and as well as approve the Roadmap based vested Sushi once the Roadmap is complete/or when individual items on the roadmap are complete.
* Help with compensation negotiations on future hires
* Observe the establishment of formal roles & responsibilities.
* Negotiate future compensation plans after the outlined ones expire.
* Review individual performance evaluations for pathways to contributor promotion, probation, or termination.
* Vet, approve, & disclose budget requests.

Compensation committee will use a simple unanimous voting system for all committee matters.

* To determine if roadmap items have been completed in a satisfactory manner & in a reasonable amount of time.
* For distribution regarding price oriented incentive targets defined by 30 day TWAP price targets.
* For validation of performance reviews.
* Similarly, a Compensation committee will also support a unanimous voting system in the event a contributor relationship requires formal termination & offboarding.
* **Management-level offboarding will require Community Oversight Committee approval.**
